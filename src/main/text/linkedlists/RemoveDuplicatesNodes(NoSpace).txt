 * Algorithm
 * 1. Maintain a runner which scans for any dupes till current node from head
 * 2. Advance the runner once it coincides with the current node
 * Note: The concept of sliding window is used here, as the runner only encounters one dupe within a given
 * move up to current, as we only advance current by one node till end
